Hi , this is my collection of small web development projects .
1st project --> Blurry image loader (scale : mini) It is a simple image loader which loads the image everytime one loads the page. ⟫I used JS to create the percentage loader which is nothing but just a increment function put into a setInterval() function. ⟫Created an animation where the image gets less blurrier in the same time interval as it takes to load from 0% to 100%. ⟫I tried both CSS and JS method of making the loaded percentage disappear slowly as it comes near 100%.
