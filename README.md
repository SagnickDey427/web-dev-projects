Hi , this is my collection of small web development projects .

🎯 1st project --> Blurry image loader : It is a simple image loader which loads the image everytime one loads the page. 

  ⟫I used JS to create the percentage loader which is nothing but just a increment function put into a setInterval() function. 
  
  ⟫Created an animation where the image gets less blurrier in the same time interval as it takes to load from 0% to 100%. 
  
  ⟫I tried both CSS and JS method of making the loaded percentage disappear slowly as it comes near 100%.

🎯 2nd project --> Vertical slider : It is a simple slider that changes the image and it's corresponding text slide as we press buttons.

  ⟫First i designed the basic structure of the website, created text and image slides.

  ⟫I created a function changeSlide() that takes the direction of arrow and changes the current active slide index correspondingly, hence i also added the transform property to both left and right slides.
